To replace your on-demand EKS instance with a reserved instance for 1 year, you can follow these steps:

Determine the specifications of the reserved instance you want to purchase. Make sure it matches or exceeds the specifications of your current on-demand instance (in this case, c6i.xlarge). You can find the available reserved instance types and pricing on the Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances Pricing page.

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 service.

In the EC2 dashboard, click on "Reserved Instances" in the left-hand navigation pane.

Click on the "Purchase Reserved Instances" button.

On the "Purchase Reserved Instances" page, select the region where your EKS instance is deployed.

Choose the "Standard" offering class. This class provides the most flexibility in terms of instance utilization and availability zone coverage.

Select the reserved instance type that matches or exceeds the specifications of your current on-demand instance (c6i.xlarge).

Choose the desired duration for the reserved instance. In this case, select "1 Year."

Review the pricing details and click on the "Add to Cart" button.

On the "Review Instance Details" page, confirm that the instance type, term, and pricing information are correct.

Select the number of reserved instances you want to purchase. Since you want to replace your existing on-demand instance, select the appropriate quantity.

Click on the "Add to Cart" button to proceed.

On the "Purchase Confirmation" page, review the details once again to ensure everything is correct.

Click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button.

On the "Checkout" page, select your payment method and provide the necessary billing information.

Once you've reviewed and confirmed the purchase details, click on the "Place your order" button.

After the purchase is complete, you will receive a confirmation of your reserved instance purchase.

Now that you have a reserved instance, you can modify your EKS cluster to use it.

Go to the Amazon EKS console.

Select your cluster, and in the cluster details page, click on the "Configuration" tab.

Under the "Compute" section, click on the "Update" button.

In the "Update compute configuration" dialog, select the "Use existing EC2 instances" option.

From the "Instances" dropdown, select your existing on-demand instance.

Under "Advanced options," select the reserved instance you just purchased.

Click on the "Update" button to apply the changes.

The cluster will now be updated to use the reserved instance instead of the on-demand instance
